[![Play video](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ins/UltimateScripts-Ps/gh-pages/i/install.png)](https://vimeo.com/166353587)  
**[Download ZIP](https://github.com/ins/UltimateScripts-Ps/archive/master.zip)** and **move** *UltimateScripts* folder to Photoshop's Scripts folder:  
Windows 10 - C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2017\Presets\Scripts\  
Mac - Applications/Adobe Photoshop CC 2017/Presets/Scripts

**Restart Photoshop** and the scripts will show up at the bottom of the **Filter menu**.

(Alternatively you can run the scripts from any folder by double-clicking, but then they will not show up in the Filter menu.)

### Uninstallation
Delete the *UltimateScripts* folder from the *Presets/Scripts* folder.

### Customize
You can delete any script that you don't need - except *common.js* - things will not break.

The image placing part was inspired by the Photos panel of [InVision LABS Craft](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft), but the starting point was the [Instagram Design Tools](https://github.com/iansilber/ig-design-tools) (THANKS!).
