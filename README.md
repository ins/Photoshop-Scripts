**Image placer/replacer, Resize to fill and Guidelines scripts for Windows Photoshop users**

## Installation
1. Download zip and extract to photoshop scripts folder:  
Windows 10 - C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2015\Presets\Scripts\

2. Open Photoshop and find the scripts on the bottom of *Filter* menu.  
(I use this for faster access, instead of the *File/Scripts* folder)

3. To use the Clip scripts, first click *Filter/Select Folder of Images to Clip*.  
This will ask for a folder of images, and will save a settings file to your *Desktop*, to remember your folder next time you open Photoshop.

## Uninstallation
Delete the files from the scripts folder

InVision LABS Craft plugins and https://github.com/iansilber/ig-design-tools.  
If you use osX, try Craft, it's awesome!
