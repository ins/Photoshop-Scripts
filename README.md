**Image placer/replacer, Resize to fill, and Guidelines scripts for Windows Photoshop users**

## Installation
1. Download zip and extract to photoshop scripts folder:  
Windows 10 - C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2015\Presets\Scripts\

2. Open Photoshop and find the scripts on the bottom of Filter menu.  
(I use this for faster access, instead of the file/scripts folder)

## Uninstallation
Delete the files from the scripts folder


### Inspired by
InVision LABS Craft plugins and https://github.com/iansilber/ig-design-tools.  
If you use osX, try Craft, it's awesome!
