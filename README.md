### Customize
You can delete any script that you don't need - except *common.js* - things will not break.

The image placing part is inspired by the Photos panel of [InVision LABS Craft](https://www.invisionapp.com/craft), but the starting point was the [Instagram Design Tools](https://github.com/iansilber/ig-design-tools).
